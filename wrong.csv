"d3f:OperatingSystem",d3f:InterprocessCommunication,"a denial of service in clfs.sys in microsoft windows 10, windows 11, windows server 2016, windows server 2019, and windows server 2022 allows a malicious authenticated low-privilege user to cause a blue screen of death via a forced call to the kebugcheckex function."
"d3f:OperatingSystem",d3f:FileSystem,"an elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the windows data sharing service improperly handles file operations, aka \"windows data sharing service elevation of privilege vulnerability.\" this affects windows server 2016, windows 10, windows server 2019, windows 10 servers."
