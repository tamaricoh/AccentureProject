d3f:BootLoader,EMILE,dbpedia,"EMILE is the Early Mac Image LoadEr, a bootloader for loading Linux on Macintosh computers that have m68k processors. It was written by , and is meant to eventually replace the Penguin booter that is more usually in use. In contrast to the Penguin booter, which requires a working classic Mac OS installation, EMILE modifies the boot block on a hard disk to boot Linux directly."
d3f:BootLoader,LILO (bootloader),dbpedia,"LILO (Linux Loader) is a boot loader for Linux and was the default boot loader for most Linux distributions in the years after the popularity of loadlin. Today, many distributions use GRUB as the default boot loader, but LILO and its variant ELILO are still in wide use. Further development of LILO was discontinued in December 2015 along with a request by Joachim Wiedorn for potential developers."
d3f:BootLoader,LILO (bootloader)  elilo  1,dbpedia,"LILO (Linux Loader) is a popular boot loader used in Linux operating systems. It allows users to choose from multiple installed operating systems or kernels during the system startup process. While LILO was the default boot loader for most Linux distributions in the past, it has been largely replaced by GRUB. However, LILO and its variant ELILO are still widely used. To identify the bootloader on a Linux system, one can check for specific configuration files or use the dd command to read the boot sector of the hard drive."
d3f:BootLoader,GNU GRUB,dbpedia,"GNU GRUB (short for GNU GRand Unified Bootloader, commonly referred to as GRUB) is a boot loader package from the GNU Project. GRUB is the reference implementation of the Free Software Foundation's Multiboot Specification, which provides a user the choice to boot one of multiple operating systems installed on a computer or select a specific kernel configuration available on a particular operating system's partitions."
d3f:BootLoader,SILO (bootloader),dbpedia,"The SPARC Improved bootLOader (SILO) is the bootloader used by the SPARC port of the Linux operating system; it can also be used for Solaris as a replacement for the standard Solaris boot loader. SILO generally looks similar to the basic version of LILO, giving a ""boot:"" prompt, at which the user can press the Tab key to see the available images to boot. The configuration file format is reasonably similar to LILO's, as well as some of the command-line options. However, SILO differs significantly from LILO because it reads and parses the configuration file at boot time, so it is not necessary to re-run it after every change to the file or to the installed kernel images. SILO is able to access ext2, ext3, ext4, UFS, romfs and ISO 9660 file systems, enabling it to boot arbitrary kernels from "
d3f:BootLoader,System Commander,dbpedia,"System Commander (SC for short) is a graphical boot manager/loader software application developed by VCOM.

Other software with similar functionality includes NTLDR, LILO, GRUB, and . One of its components was named ."
d3f:Command,Passwd  passwd  1,dbpedia,"The passwd command in Linux is a powerful tool used to manage password-related tasks. It allows system administrators and users to change user passwords, update password aging policies, unlock accounts, and more. The command works by hashing the input password and comparing it with the stored hashed password for validation. The /etc/passwd file contains information for all user accounts, including user ID, group ID, home directory, and default shell. Only the root user or users with sudo privileges can modify this file. The passwd command is used to modify a user's password and its properties, such as deleting the password, expiring the password, deactivating the account, and more."

d3f:Command,Unlink (Unix),dbpedia,"In Unix-like operating systems, unlink is a system call and a command line utility to delete files. The program directly interfaces the system call, which removes the file name and (but not on GNU systems) directories like rm and rmdir. If the file name was the last hard link to the file, the file itself is deleted as soon as no program has it open. It also appears in the PHP, Node.js, R, Perl and Python standard libraries in the form of the unlink built-in function. Like the Unix utility, it is also used to delete files."
d3f:Command,Diff,dbpedia,"In computing, the utility diff is a data comparison tool that computes and displays the differences between the contents of files. Unlike edit distance notions used for other purposes, diff is line-oriented rather than character-oriented, but it is like Levenshtein distance in that it tries to determine the smallest set of deletions and insertions to create one file from the other. The utility displays the changes in one of several standard formats, such that both humans or computers can parse the changes, and use them for patching."
d3f:Command,Chattr,dbpedia,"chattr is the command in Linux that allows a user to set certain attributes of a file. lsattr is the command that displays the attributes of a file. Most BSD-like systems, including macOS, have always had an analogous chflags command to set the attributes, but no command specifically meant to display them; specific options to the ls command are used instead. The chflags command first appeared in 4.4BSD. Solaris has no commands specifically meant to manipulate them. chmod and ls are used instead."
d3f:Command,Join (Unix),dbpedia,join is a command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that merges the lines of two sorted text files based on the presence of a common field. It is similar to the join operator used in relational databases but operating on text files.

A dump command is also part of ASCII's MSX-DOS2 Tools for MSX-DOS version 2."
d3f:Command,Speak (Unix),dbpedia,"speak was a Unix utility that used a predefined set of rules to turn a file of English text into phoneme data compatible with a (later Votrax) model VS4 ""Votrax"" Speech Synthesizer. It was first included in Unix v3 and possibly later ones, with the OS-end support files and help files persisting until v6. As of late 2011, the original source code for speak, and portions of speak.m (which is generated from speak.v) were discovered. At least three versions of the man page are known to still exist."
d3f:Command,Cpio,dbpedia,"cpio is a general file archiver utility and its associated file format. It is primarily installed on Unix-like computer operating systems. The software utility was originally intended as a tape archiving program as part of the Programmer's Workbench (PWB/UNIX), and has been a component of virtually every Unix operating system released thereafter. Its name is derived from the phrase copy in and out, in close description of the program's use of standard input and standard output in its operation. POSIX abandoned cpio command in favor of pax command."

On Unix, device drivers for hardware (such as hard disk drives) and special device files (such as /dev/zero and /dev/random) appear in the file system just like normal files; dd can also read and/or write from/to these files, provided that function is implemented in their respective driver. As a result, dd can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot sector of a hard drive, and obtaining a fixed amount of random data. The dd program can also perform conversions on the data as it is copied, including byte order swapping and conversion to and from the ASCII and EBCDIC text encodings."
d3f:Command,Regsvr32,dbpedia,"In computing, regsvr32 (Register Server) is a command-line utility in Microsoft Windows and ReactOS for registering and unregistering DLLs and ActiveX controls in the operating system Registry. Despite the suffix ""32"" in the name of the file, there are both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of this utility (with identical names, but in different directories). regsvr32 requires elevated privileges.

However, unlike mv, ren cannot be used to move files, as a new directory for the destination file may not be used. Alternatively, <a href=""/wiki/Move_(command)"" title=""Move (command)"">move</a> may be used if available. On versions of MS-DOS that do not support the move command (older than 6.00), the user would simply copy the file to a new destination, and the"

The history of the route is recorded as the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) in the route (path); the sum of the mean times in each hop is a measure of the total time spent to establish the connection. Traceroute proceeds unless all (usually three) sent packets are lost more than twice; then the connection is lost and the route cannot be evaluated.
