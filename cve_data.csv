0,d3f:System Software,Linux Kernel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: erofs: reliably distinguish block based and fscache mode When erofs_kill_sb() is called in block dev based mode, s_bdev may not have been initialised yet, and if CONFIG_EROFS_FS_ONDEMAND is enabled, it will be mistaken for fscache mode, and then attempt to free an anon_dev that has never been allocated, triggering the following warning: ============================================ ida_free called for id=0 which is not allocated.

1,d3f:System Software,Linux Kernel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi: lpfc: Move NPIV's transport unregistration to after resource clean up There are cases after NPIV deletion where the fabric switch still believes the NPIV is logged into the fabric. This occurs when a vport is unregistered before the Remove All DA_ID CT and LOGO ELS are sent to the fabric. Currently fc_remove_host(), which calls dev_loss_tmo for all D_IDs including the fabric D_ID, removes the last ndlp reference and frees the ndlp rport object. This sometimes causes the race condition where the final DA_ID and LOGO are skipped from being sent to the fabric switch. Fix by moving the fc_remove_host() and scsi_remove_host() calls after DA_ID and LOGO are sent."
2,d3f:System Software,Linux Kernel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ice: ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated Currently, we allocate a count-sized kernel buffer and copy count bytes from userspace to that buffer. Later, we use sscanf on this buffer but we don't ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead to OOB read when using sscanf. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul instead of memdup_user."
3,d3f:System Software,Linux Kernel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: scsi: lpfc: Release hbalock before calling lpfc_worker_wake_up() lpfc_worker_wake_up() calls the lpfc_work_done() routine, which takes the hbalock. Thus, lpfc_worker_wake_up() should not be called while holding the hbalock to avoid potential deadlock."
4,d3f:System Software,Linux Kernel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mmc: sdhci-msm: pervent access to suspended controller Generic sdhci code registers LED device and uses host->runtime_suspended flag to protect access to it. The sdhci-msm driver doesn't set this flag, which causes a crash when LED is accessed while controller is runtime suspended. Fix this by setting the flag correctly."
5,d3f:System Software,Linux Kernel,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: fs: Fix uninitialized value issue in from_kuid and from_kgid ocfs2_setattr() uses attr->ia_mode, attr->ia_uid and attr->ia_gid in a trace point even though ATTR_MODE, ATTR_UID and ATTR_GID aren't set.
