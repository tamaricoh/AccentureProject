# LLM Project for Accenture

## Environment Setup

The project was developed in a **Conda environment** using Python 3.12. All the necessary libraries and dependencies were installed within this environment to ensure smooth execution and reproducibility.

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for setting up and running the project are provided in the associated Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`). This notebook outlines the steps to:
1. Set up the Conda environment.
2. Import necessary libraries.
3. Load and preprocess the dataset.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Continue with model training and evaluation (in the near future).

Please refer to the notebook for specific commands and explanations.

## Requirements

- Conda environment (Python 3.12)
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the notebook)
- Dataset file (`dataset.csv`)

## How to Run

1. Create and activate the Conda environment as described in the notebook.
2. Run the notebook to load and preprocess the data, then proceed with model training.

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the notebook for troubleshooting and further guidance.
