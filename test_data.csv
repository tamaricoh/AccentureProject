d3f:OperatingSystem,"Berkeley Software Design  , Inc.  1",dbpedia,"Berkeley Software Design, Inc. (BSDi) is a company that obtained the source code of the BSD operating system, which is derived from Research Unix. BSDi filled in the missing pieces and ported it to the Intel i386 computer architecture. They started selling the resulting BSD/386 operating system in 1991. BSD is an open-source operating system developed at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1970s. It is a UNIX-like operating system that initially differed from UNIX but later shared much of its source code. BSD and BSD-based operating systems have become widely used in computing, including powering significant parts of modern Internet infrastructure."
d3f:Software,Zenobi,dbpedia,"Zenobi was a video game company that was known for its interactive fiction. The company was started by John Wilson in 1986 and continued in various forms until 2013. The company produced and published adventure games for the ZX Spectrum (along with the Atari ST) range of home computers, operating as a commercial entity from 1986 to 1997, selling the titles by mail-order. Emulator images were also available for PC and Amiga users. In its later years Zenobi concentrated on emulator users and produced numerous compilation CDs and DVDs."
d3f:Database,DBOMP,dbpedia,"DBOMP (Database Organization and Maintenance Processor) was an early hierarchical database system from IBM for DOS. DBOMP was introduced in the late 1960s as a successor to IBM's ""Bill of Materials Processor"" called BOMP, introduced in 1965 when DOS became available. There is some disagreement as to whether DBOMP should be called a hierarchical or a network database. This was a marketing competition between IBM and competitive offerings: network had become popular, and BOMP and DBOMP did have network characteristics, but these were limited."
d3f:DisplayServer,Mir (software),dbpedia,"Mir is a computer display server and, recently, a Wayland compositor for the Linux operating system that is under development by Canonical Ltd. It was planned to replace the currently used X Window System for Ubuntu; however, the plan changed and Mutter was adopted as part of GNOME Shell. Mir was announced by Canonical on 4 March 2013 as part of the development of Unity 8, intended as the next generation for the Unity user interface. Four years later Unity 8 was dropped although Mir's development continued for Internet of Things (IoT) applications."
d3f:Database,DVD Profiler,dbpedia,"DVD Profiler is a program that allows users to catalogue their DVD collections. The program was created by Ken Cole at InterVocative Software. Although it can be used for free (with free registration), it can be upgraded to a premium registration for a one-time fee. Registration allows users to download higher-resolution cover scans, to vote on all changes to the DVD database, and to use the newest beta versions of the software. Since December 2010 there's also an app for iPhone and iPad available which works as a standalone product or in combination with the Desktop version."
d3f:Software,Veyon,dbpedia,"Veyon (Virtual Eye On Networks) is a free and open source software for monitoring and controlling computers across multiple platforms. Veyon supports users in teaching in digital learning environments, performing virtual trainings or giving remote support."
d3f:FileSystem,PUFFS (NetBSD),dbpedia,"Pass-to-Userspace Framework File System (puffs) is a NetBSD kernel subsystem developed for running filesystems in userspace. It was added to NetBSD in the 5.0 release, and was ported to DragonFly BSD in the 3.2 release."
d3f:HardwareDriver,DarwiinRemote,dbpedia,"DarwiinRemote is an application for Mac OS X v10.4 or above which allows Wii Remote to fully control applications on a Mac. The software includes a desktop application and a developers' framework, allowing for additional functionality. To use the software, the computer must have Bluetooth enabled."
d3f:Software,ManyCam,dbpedia,ManyCam is an application program that allows users to use their webcam with multiple different video chat and video streaming applications simultaneously for Windows and MacOS computers. Users can also add live graphics effects and filters to video feeds. ManyCam is available for annual or biennial licensing in different versions. It was previously published as freeware. ManyCam also publishes mobile apps.
d3f:HardwareDriver,SCSI Pass-Through Direct  SCSI Pass Through Direct SPTD  1,dbpedia,"SCSI Pass-Through Direct (SPTD) is a driver that allows users to send commands to a SCSI device from the user space. It can be used with kernel extensions or driverkit to match with a specific device and pass commands to it. This driver is commonly used in Apple systems. It is recommended to select LSI Logic SAS as the type of SCSI controller and create a new SCSI controller instead of using a default one. SCSI Bus sharing mode can be set to virtual or physical depending on the need to share a virtual disk between virtual machines (VMs) on the same ESXi host or share a VMDK file between VMs. Windows Server 2012 R2 and later versions support SCSI controllers, particularly for shared virtual hard disks. It is advised to attach multiple disks to a single virtual SCSI controller for optimal performance. SCSI is not commonly used in consumer hardware devices but is still prevalent in business and enterprise server environments."
d3f:InterprocessCommunication,OpenBinder,dbpedia,"OpenBinder is a system for inter-process communication. It was developed at Be Inc. and then Palm, Inc. and was the basis for the Binder framework now used in the Android operating system developed by Google. The kernel-side component of the Linux version of OpenBinder was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.19, which was released on February 8, 2015."
d3f:FileSystem,Radmind,dbpedia,"Radmind is a suite of Unix command-line tools and an application server designed to remotely administer the file systems of multiple client machines. For Mac OS X, there is a graphical user interface called Radmind Assistant, as well as a GUI for the Radmind server called Radmind Server Manager. Radmind was the 2003 Apple Design Awards runner-up for Best Mac OS X Server Solution. Radmind is developed by the Research Systems Unix Group at the University of Michigan."
d3f:HardwareDriver,AMD Radeon Software,dbpedia,AMD Radeon Software is a device driver and utility software package for Advanced Micro Devices's graphics cards and APUs. Its graphical user interface is built with Electron and is compatible with 64-bit Windows and Linux distributions.
d3f:DisplayServer,XDarwin,dbpedia,"XDarwin is an obsolete X Window System (X11) display server for the Darwin operating system and early versions of Mac OS X. XDarwin allows one to use programs written for X11 on those operating systems. XDarwin was ported by the XonX project, an offshoot project created by XFree86 developers. It is integrated in the upstream source code of the XFree86 and Xorg servers, where it is maintained."
d3f:BootLoader,GNU GRUB,dbpedia,"GNU GRUB (short for GNU GRand Unified Bootloader, commonly referred to as GRUB) is a boot loader package from the GNU Project. GRUB is the reference implementation of the Free Software Foundation's Multiboot Specification, which provides a user the choice to boot one of multiple operating systems installed on a computer or select a specific kernel configuration available on a particular operating system's partitions."
d3f:Database,TokuMX,dbpedia,"TokuMX is an open-source distribution of MongoDB which, among other things, replaces the default B-tree data structure found in the basic MongoDB distribution with a fractal tree index. It is a drop-in replacement for MongoDB (applications will run ""as is"") that offers the scalability and performance improvements associated with fractal tree indexing. It also adds support for document-level locking, transaction support with ACID and MVCC, and replication optimization; it does not support full-text search."
d3f:OperatingSystem,Parakey,dbpedia,"Parakey is a web-based computer user interface proposed by Firefox contributors Blake Ross and Joe Hewitt. Ross describes it as ""a Web operating system that can do everything an OS can do."" The idea behind it is to make image, video, and writing transfer to the web easier. He explains that the current problem with transferring data to the web is that in order to move an image onto the web you first have to transfer pictures from your digital camera, then upload them to a place like Flickr. Or, if you want to rant, you launch a blog on blogger.com before you can start talking."
