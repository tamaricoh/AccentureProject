    "### Setting Up Conda Environment with Python 3.12 and Installing Required Libraries\n",
    "##### Step 1 - Created a Conda Environment with Python 3.12 and Connected to its Kernel\n",
    "I created a new Conda environment with Python 3.12 and activated it. After that, I connected to the Python kernel in Jupyter/VSCode using this environment.\n",
    "Commands to create and activate the environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n llm_env python=3.12\n",
    "conda activate llm_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2 - Imported Required Libraries\n",
    "Once the environment was set up and activated, I imported the following libraries for my project:\n",
    "- `numpy` as `np`: For numerical operations and working with arrays.\n",
    "- `pandas` as `pd`: For data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- `torch`: PyTorch, for deep learning model building and training.\n",
    "- `tqdm.notebook`: For displaying progress bars in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- `sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder`: For encoding categorical labels into numerical format.\n",
    "- `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`: For splitting datasets into training and testing sets.\n",
    "- `transformers.BertTokenizer`: For tokenizing text data for BERT models.\n",
    "- `transformers.BertForSequenceClassification`: For using BERT for sequence classification tasks.\n",
    "- `torch.utils.data.TensorDataset`: For creating datasets from tensors.\n",
    "- `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`: For batching datasets and loading them efficiently during training.\n",
    "- `torch.utils.data.RandomSampler` and `torch.utils.data.SequentialSampler`: For random and sequential sampling of datasets.\n",
    "- `transformers.AdamW` and `transformers.get_linear_schedule_with_warmup`: For the AdamW optimizer and learning rate scheduler used with transformers.\n",
    "- `sklearn.metrics.f1_score`: For evaluating model performance using the F1 score.\n",
    "- `random`: For random number generation, typically used in data shuffling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands to install the libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn tqdm pytorch\n",
    "conda install -c huggingface transformers"
